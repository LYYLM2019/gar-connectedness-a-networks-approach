We investigate the spillover effects of GDP growth volatility over 12 OECD mem-ber countries.  Understanding the growth-at-risk of GDP has been a popular areaof discussion in recent years.  Even more recently, it has been increasingly impera-tive to acknowledge GDP spillover effects, particularly from the lower quantiles ofits conditional distribution.  Utilizing methods introduced by Adrian, Boyarchenko,and Giannone (2019), we observe the quantile dynamics of these 12 OECD mem-ber  countries  with  respect  to  the  vulnerability  of  GDP  growth  as  a  function  ofrelative financial and economic conditions.  A natural extension is to employ net-work analysis to investigate spillover effects and determine interconnectedness fromgrowth-at-risk.
